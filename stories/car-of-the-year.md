It's here, the all-new [BMW]. The most luxurious
[zebra] you'll ever drive! The only four-door [heart] that
comes equipped with dual air [forks]s, power [music]s,
and contoured, plush leather [flowers]s. And, believe it or not,
it is the only car in its class that can go up to a hundred thousand
[fingers]s without needing a [water] change or
a [foot] tune-up. Run, do not [walk] to your nearest
[BMW].dealer and feast your [fingers] on
the car that Motor [bike] magazine calls the [insane]
[car] of the year. As always, we save the best for last. When
you see the sticker price, you are sure to shout, "[exclamation]!"
